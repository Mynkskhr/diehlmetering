NIS2 Is Now Law in Germany
==========================

Why December 6, 2025 and January 6, 2026 mark a structural shift for regulated
organisations operating in Germany and across the EU.

Subtitle
--------

From “future directive” to enforceable national law with mandatory registration,
incident reporting, and executive accountability.

Context for Diehl Metering
--------------------------

The EU NIS2 Directive is no longer a future regulatory concept.  
In Germany, it has been fully transposed into national law and is now
**legally binding**.

For organisations like Diehl Metering — operating across multiple EU countries,
serving utilities, municipalities, and critical infrastructure customers —
this transition changes NIS2 from a compliance discussion into an **operational
and governance requirement**.

Key Dates That Matter
---------------------

**December 6, 2025 — NIS2 enters into force in Germany**

On this date, Germany’s implementation of NIS2 became binding law through the
*NIS-2-Umsetzungs- und Cybersicherheitsstärkungsgesetz (NIS2UmsuCG)*.

From this point onward:

- NIS2 obligations are enforceable, not optional
- Supervisory authorities (BSI) gain expanded inspection and enforcement powers
- Management responsibility becomes explicit and traceable
- Fines, sanctions, and procurement consequences become real risks

NIS2 can no longer be treated as a “coming directive” or postponed initiative.

**January 6, 2026 — Mandatory BSI Portal Goes Live**

On January 6, 2026, Germany opens the **official online portal** operated by the
Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) for:

- Mandatory registration of regulated entities
- Incident reporting under NIS2
- Ongoing supervisory interaction

From this date forward:

- Compliance becomes **observable**, not declarative
- Incident handling and reporting timelines are enforced
- Evidence of risk management, secure development, and governance is expected
- Regulatory engagement becomes continuous, not episodic

For executives, this marks the point where **visibility, preparedness, and
documentation quality** directly affect regulatory outcomes.

Why This Matters at Executive Level
-----------------------------------

NIS2 explicitly strengthens management accountability.

This includes:

- Responsibility at Board, Division Board, SVP, and VP level
- Obligation to ensure risk management measures are implemented
- Oversight of secure development, vulnerability handling, and incident response
- Personal accountability in cases of systemic failure or negligence

NIS2 is therefore not an IT or security-only topic.  
It is a **governance, risk, and business continuity issue**.

The Risk of Treating NIS2 as “Just Compliance”
----------------------------------------------

Organisations that approach NIS2 as a checkbox exercise face predictable risks:

- Fragmented country-by-country implementations
- Duplication of effort and documentation
- Engineering teams becoming bottlenecks for explanations and evidence
- Reactive responses to audits, incidents, and tenders
- Inconsistent narratives toward regulators and customers

This approach increases cost and uncertainty — without increasing assurance.

What Changes with the Thinkwerke Approach
-----------------------------------------

Thinkwerke treats NIS2 as an **execution problem**, not a documentation problem.

Instead of static policies, the focus is on:

- Operational risk management embedded in engineering and cloud platforms
- Continuous evidence generated through normal delivery processes
- Clear separation between policy, implementation, and proof
- Executive-accessible documentation that does not require technical translation
- A single execution framework adaptable to country-specific NIS2 requirements

This allows Diehl Metering to:

- Comply with German law today
- Adapt efficiently as other EU countries complete their NIS2 transpositions
- Reuse the same evidence for ISO 27001, CRA, and customer assurance
- Maintain growth and delivery speed without re-architecture

Key Takeaway
------------

As of **December 6, 2025**, NIS2 is binding law in Germany.  
As of **January 6, 2026**, compliance becomes operationally visible through
mandatory registration and reporting.

NIS2 is no longer a future concern.

The question for Diehl Metering is no longer *if* NIS2 applies —  
but **how it is executed, governed, and demonstrated** in a way that supports
business strategy, sales, and long-term resilience.
