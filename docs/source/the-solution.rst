The Solution
============

To address the challenges of operating across multiple European regulatory
regimes, Diehl Metering requires a solution that is unified at its core while
remaining adaptable at the country and product level.

Thinkwerke provides a structured execution model that translates regulatory
requirements into operational reality — without creating fragmentation,
duplication, or constraints on growth.

### One unified execution model

At the core of the approach is a single compliance and security execution
framework that applies consistently across:

• Countries and national NIS2 interpretations  
• Software products and digital platforms  
• Cloud and vendor-hosted environments  

This model establishes a common baseline for governance, technical controls,
and evidence generation, while allowing country-specific requirements to be
applied as overlays rather than separate programs.

### Evidence as a business asset

Rather than treating compliance as documentation, the Thinkwerke approach
focuses on producing reusable, verifiable evidence directly from how systems
are built and operated.

This enables:

• Consistent responses to tenders and customer assurance  
• Clear explanations for regulators and auditors  
• Reduced dependency on ad-hoc technical involvement  
• Confidence in executive-level reporting  

Evidence becomes a shared asset that supports sales, audits, and strategic
decision-making.

### Designed for scale and longevity

The execution model is intentionally designed to avoid:

• Platform lock-in  
• Forced re-architecture  
• One-off compliance projects  

Security and compliance are embedded into existing development and hosting
models, allowing products and platforms to evolve without repeated compliance
reset efforts.

### Leadership-level visibility and control

The solution provides leadership with clear insight into:

• What is required  
• What is imple
