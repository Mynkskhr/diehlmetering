The Reality of Operating NIS2 Across Europe
===========================================

Why NIS2 is not a single compliance exercise.

Multi-Country Reality
---------------------
Diehl Metering operates across multiple EU member states.
Each country applies NIS2 differently, with distinct supervisory authorities,
expectations, and enforcement maturity.

The Executive Risk
------------------
- Compliance uncertainty blocks sales
- Regulatory exposure increases
- Engineering becomes the bottleneck

Why current approaches fail
---------------------------
- Treating NIS2 as one checkbox creates hidden gaps
- Treating each country separately creates duplication and chaos
