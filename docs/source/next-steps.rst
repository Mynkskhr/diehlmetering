Next Steps
==========

The path forward is designed to be controlled, low-risk, and aligned with
Diehl Metering’s business priorities.

Rather than initiating a large-scale compliance programme, Thinkwerke
recommends starting with a focused and measurable scope that demonstrates
value early and establishes a scalable foundation.

### Regulatory context in Germany

The NIS2 Directive is no longer a theoretical or future requirement.

Germany has completed the transposition of NIS2 into national law, with
enforcement obligations taking effect from **6 January 2026**.

From this date:

• NIS2 requirements become legally binding under German law  
• Supervisory authorities gain enforcement and sanctioning powers  
• Evidence-based compliance becomes a regulatory expectation, not an option  

This creates a clear timeline for action while still allowing structured,
planned execution rather than reactive compliance.

### Start with a defined Proof of Value

The initial phase focuses on:

• A selected product line or platform  
• A representative country baseline for NIS2 (Germany)  
• Core CRA and ISO/IEC 27001 requirements  
• Evidence generation aligned with real operations  

This allows leadership to validate the execution model using tangible
outputs rather than assumptions.

### Build confidence through real evidence

The Proof of Value produces:

• Business-readable compliance artefacts  
• Executive-level explanations suitable for customers and authorities  
• Reusable evidence for tenders and assurance  
• Clear visibility into ownership and accountability  

This creates immediate value while reducing uncertainty.

### Scale progressively across Europe

Once validated, the same execution model can be extended:

• Across additional countries using national NIS2 overlays  
• Across product portfolios and platforms  
• Into sales, tender, and customer assurance processes  

No re-architecture, rework, or reset is required.

### Maintain leadership control

Throughout the process:

• Strategic decisions remain with business leadership  
• Technical implementation follows agreed direction  
• Documentation remains accessible to non-technical stakeholders  

This ensures long-term independence, clarity, and resilience.

while protecting growth, innovation, and strategic flexibility.
