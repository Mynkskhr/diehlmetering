Why This Matters
================

Cybersecurity and regulatory compliance have become strategic business
topics for Diehl Metering — not technical side concerns.

As Diehl Metering operates across multiple European countries, regulatory
requirements such as NIS2, the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), and ISO/IEC 27001
now directly affect business continuity, market access, and customer trust.
These regulations are enforced nationally, interpreted differently by
authorities, and increasingly referenced by customers during procurement
and assurance processes.

Germany has completed the transposition of the NIS2 Directive into national law.

From 6 January 2026, NIS2 obligations become legally enforceable in Germany,
including supervisory oversight and sanctioning powers.

Thinkwerke supports organisations in moving from regulatory interpretation
to evidence-based execution — enabling compliance without disrupting
product development, sales, or platform growth.


For leadership, this creates three realities:

• Compliance outcomes influence revenue, not just risk  
• Evidence is expected, not statements of intent  
• Fragmented approaches do not scale across countries or product lines  

Customers, regulators, and partners no longer assess organisations only on
policy maturity. They expect to see how security and compliance are embedded
into software products, cloud platforms, and vendor-hosted environments — and
how this can be proven consistently.

Without a unified execution model, organisations face:

• Slower and riskier tender submissions  
• Repeated country-by-country compliance efforts  
• Increased dependency on technical teams to explain risk  
• Reduced executive visibility and control  

This is why compliance can no longer be treated as a local, technical, or
documentation-only exercise. It must be designed as a business capability
that supports growth, scale, and long-term resilience across Europe.
