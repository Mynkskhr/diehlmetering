Always Ready and Avaliable Documentation (DOCaaS)
=================================================

Executive-accessible, continuously maintained assurance documentation
for Diehl Metering — owned, updated, and governed by Thinkwerke.

***From static documents to living proof of security, compliance, and control.***

Why This Matters to Executives
------------------------------

In many organisations, security and compliance documentation is:

- Fragmented across teams
- Outdated the moment it is written
- Locked inside engineering tools
- Dependent on individual contributors
- Unavailable when executives need answers

At Diehl Metering, this risk is amplified by:

- Distributed hosting and product teams
- Multiple countries and regulators
- Vendor-hosted platforms
- High reliance on engineering explanations during audits and tenders

**This creates decision risk at executive level.**

Thinkwerke’s DOCaaS Model
------------------------

Thinkwerke introduces **Documentation as a Service (DOCaaS)**:

**Living assurance documentation that is:**

- Continuously updated
- Directly linked to technical evidence
- Accessible to executives without engineering mediation
- Reusable across audits, tenders, and customer assurance

This documentation is not a report.

It is an **operational asset**.

What “Living” Means in Practice
-------------------------------

Documentation evolves automatically as the system evolves.

Changes in:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud configurations
- Vulnerability posture
- Product architecture
- Regulatory mappings

→ are reflected in documentation through evidence links, artefacts, and traceability.

There is no “documentation phase”.
There is no “update scramble”.

Ownership and Accountability
----------------------------

A critical failure in many compliance programs is **unclear ownership**.

Thinkwerke explicitly owns:

- Structure of assurance documentation
- Regulatory mappings (NIS2, CRA, ISO 27001)
- Evidence linkage and traceability
- Executive summaries and narratives

This eliminates:

- Consultant walk-away risk
- Knowledge loss during team changes
- Dependency on individual engineers
- Conflicting or falsified documentation

Executive-Level Access (No Technical Gatekeeping)
-------------------------------------------------

Executives and senior managers can directly access:

- NIS2 readiness status by country
- CRA preparation progress
- Open risks and mitigation status
- Evidence used in audits and tenders
- Architecture decisions and rationale

No Jira access required.
No Git access required.
No dependency on technical explanations.

This enables leadership to:

- Take informed strategic decisions
- Challenge assumptions with evidence
- Confidently engage regulators and customers
- Direct product and platform strategy

Real-World Risk Reduction
-------------------------

Historical failures often trace back to:

- Missing migration documentation
- Unexplained architecture decisions
- Incomplete vendor responsibility mapping
- Undocumented incidents and outages

Living assurance documentation prevents:

- Post-incident confusion
- Reactive explanations
- Reputational damage
- Loss of executive confidence

By design, the documentation already contains:

- Architecture explanations
- Control ownership
- Evidence artefacts
- Decision rationale

Sales and Tender Enablement
---------------------------

The same documentation is reused externally:

- Security questionnaires
- Customer assurance workshops
- Public-sector tenders
- Regulated utility procurement

Instead of rewriting answers, Diehl Metering can:

- Reference stable documentation sections
- Attach evidence artefacts
- Demonstrate maturity and consistency

This directly accelerates sales cycles.

- :doc:`Control to Proof Mapping <docs.thinkwerke.com/en/latest/evidence-library/control-to-proof>`

Executive Outcome
-----------------

For SVPs, Directors, and the Division Board, DOCaaS delivers:

- Continuous visibility without operational noise
- Reduced dependency on technical teams
- Higher confidence during audits and incidents
- Faster, cleaner executive decision-making
- A defensible compliance posture at all times

Key Takeaway
------------

Living assurance documentation is not a deliverable.

It is **infrastructure for trust**.

Thinkwerke ensures that Diehl Metering is never:

- Blocked by missing documentation
- Dependent on unavailable teams
- Exposed by outdated narratives
- Surprised by regulatory scrutiny
