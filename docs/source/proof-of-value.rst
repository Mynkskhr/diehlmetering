Proof of Value (PoC)
====================

A low-risk, time-bound execution that demonstrates real outcomes
before full-scale rollout.

**Show - not promise - how NIS2, CRA, and ISO 27001 execution works
inside Diehl Metering, Thinkwerke is not just promision a "Proof-of-Concept", we are promising a "Proof-of-Value"**

Why a Proof of Value
--------------------

Executives are right to be cautious of large compliance programs
that promise transformation without evidence.

Thinkwerke therefore proposes a **Proof of Value (PoC)** that:

- Runs on real Diehl Metering context
- Produces real technical artefacts
- Generates reusable evidence
- Requires no irreversible architectural decisions

This PoC is designed to answer one question:

**“Does this framework work for us?”**

What the PoC Covers
-------------------

The PoC focuses on a **representative slice** of Diehl Metering’s environment,
for example:

- One product or platform
- One CI/CD pipeline
- One cloud or hosting context
- One country-specific NIS2 obligation (Germany-first)

This keeps scope controlled while outcomes remain meaningful.

Core PoC Deliverables
---------------------

During the PoC, Thinkwerke delivers:

Secure Software Lifecycle (SSLM)
--------------------------------

- Automated SAST, SCA/SBOM, DAST, IaC and container scanning
- Evidence retained per build and release
- Clear linkage between findings and remediation

Vulnerability Management Lifecycle
----------------------------------

- Central intake of vulnerabilities
- Jira-based ticketing with SLAs
- Re-validation and closure evidence
- Executive-readable status reporting

Country-Specific NIS2 Mapping
-----------------------------

- Mapping of German NIS2UmsuCG obligations
- Control ownership definition
- Evidence traceability for inspections and audits

Living Assurance Documentation
------------------------------

- Executive-accessible documentation
- Architecture explanations
- Evidence links and artefacts
- Reusable content for sales and tenders

What Executives Will See
-----------------------

By the end of the PoC, leadership can directly review:

- A working compliance execution model
- Real evidence produced by pipelines
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Country-specific NIS2 readiness
- No dependency on engineering explanations

Nothing is theoretical.

Everything is demonstrable.

Risk Containment
----------------

The PoC is deliberately designed to:

- Avoid lock-in to specific tools
- Avoid irreversible architecture changes
- Avoid disruption to delivery timelines

If leadership decides not to proceed further,
Diehl Metering still retains:

- Documentation
- Evidence artefacts
- Clear understanding of gaps and opportunities

Timeframe
---------

Typical PoC duration:

- **6–8 weeks**, depending on scope and access

This aligns with executive decision cycles
without delaying regulatory readiness.

Decision Point
--------------

At the conclusion of the PoC, leadership can make an informed decision:

- Expand to additional products or countries
- Integrate into sales and tender processes
- Align roadmap with CRA timelines
- Or pause with full transparency on outcomes

Key Takeaway
------------

The Proof of Value converts compliance discussions
into visible, measurable execution.

No leap of faith required.
