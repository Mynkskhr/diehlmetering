Executive Summary
=================

A Unified EU Cybersecurity & Compliance Framework for Diehl Metering
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Diehl Metering operates across multiple EU markets where cybersecurity expectations,
regulations, and enforcement maturity vary significantly. With NIS2 already
transposed into German national law and CRA approaching enforceability,
compliance can no longer be treated as a future consideration or a paperwork exercise.

Thinkwerke provides a structured execution model that turns regulatory
requirements into:

- a unified control framework,
- operationalised engineering practices,
- automated and reusable evidence, and
- clear, board-level visibility.

This approach enables Diehl Metering to:
- Comply with NIS2 in Germany first, then scale to other EU countries.
- Prepare for CRA without architectural disruption or last-minute crisis execution.
- Reduce dependence on engineering teams for compliance responses.
- Strengthen competitive position in utilities, municipalities, and regulated tenders.

Strategic Intent
----------------

This framework is not a consulting report.
It is a living execution program designed to:

- Protect business operations
- Enable faster sales and public tender wins
- Provide defensible executive accountability
- Move Diehl Metering ahead of market competitors

Next Steps for Executives
-------------------------

Executives can begin with three questions:

1. Can Diehl Metering *confidently* prove compliance today if requested?
2. Can we demonstrate readiness consistently across all EU countries?
3. Is compliance currently slowing sales, delivery, or engineering?

If any answer is “no”, this framework is the execution path.
