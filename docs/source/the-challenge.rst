The Challenge
=============

Diehl Metering operates in a highly regulated environment while delivering
software-enabled products and services across multiple European countries.
This creates a unique set of challenges that cannot be addressed through
isolated compliance initiatives or documentation-driven approaches.

### Multi-country regulatory complexity

Under NIS2, each EU member state applies national transpositions, supervisory
models, and enforcement practices. While the intent of the directive is
European-wide resilience, the operational reality is country-specific
requirements layered on top of a shared baseline.

For a group operating across Europe, this leads to:

• Parallel compliance efforts per country  
• Inconsistent interpretation of requirements  
• Increased coordination overhead for leadership  
• Difficulty maintaining a single, coherent posture  

### Expanding impact of CRA on software products

The Cyber Resilience Act introduces direct obligations on software and product
security, including vulnerability handling, supply-chain governance, and
evidence of secure development practices.

These requirements affect:

• Product development lifecycles  
• Release management and updates  
• Vulnerability disclosure and remediation  
• Supplier and open-source dependencies  

Without a structured execution model, CRA compliance risks becoming a blocker
to product evolution and time-to-market.

### ISO 27001 is necessary, but no longer sufficient

ISO/IEC 27001 provides an important governance baseline, but on its own it does
not satisfy:

• NIS2 supervisory expectations  
• CRA product-level requirements  
• Customer security assurance demands  
• Modern cloud and vendor-hosted accountability  

Leadership is increasingly asked to explain how controls operate in practice,
not just how they are documented.

### Business impact of the current state

Taken together, these fact
