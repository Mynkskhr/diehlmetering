Evidence & Sales Enablement
==========================

Turning security and compliance from a sales blocker
into a measurable revenue accelerator.

***How Diehl Metering embeds NIS2, CRA, and ISO 27001 evidence
directly into sales, tenders, and customer assurance.***

The Executive Reality
---------------------

In regulated markets, deals are rarely lost because of price or features.

They are lost because of:

- Slow or incomplete security questionnaires
- Inconsistent answers across regions
- Missing or unverifiable evidence
- Dependency on engineering teams for explanations
- Last-minute escalation during tenders

This creates friction at the exact point where:
- Sales needs speed
- Customers need confidence
- Executives need predictability

Thinkwerke removes this friction by design.

From Technical Controls to Business Evidence
--------------------------------------------

Thinkwerke transforms operational security controls into
**business-ready evidence**.

The flow is simple and repeatable:

[NIS2 / CRA / ISO 27001 Requirements]
            ↓
[Security & Compliance Controls]
            ↓
[CI/CD • Cloud • Product Architecture]
            ↓
[Continuous Evidence Generation]
            ↓
[Audits • Customers • Tenders • Executives]

This means:

- No manual evidence collection
- No ad-hoc document creation
- No re-explanation of the same controls

Everything already exists.

What Sales Teams Actually Use
-----------------------------

Sales and bid teams gain access to:

- Pre-mapped NIS2, CRA, ISO 27001 control responses
- Evidence artefacts linked to real implementations
- SBOMs and vulnerability posture summaries
- Architecture explanations suitable for non-technical audiences
- Consistent narratives across all regions

This allows sales to respond with confidence instead of escalation.

Tender Acceleration
-------------------

With Thinkwerke’s framework:

- Security sections are answered by reference, not rewriting
- Evidence is attached, not promised
- Claims are demonstrable, not aspirational

Result:

- Faster tender submission
- Fewer clarification rounds
- Reduced risk of disqualification
- Stronger positioning in regulated procurement

In tenders, Diehl Metering can state:

“We operate a continuous Secure Software Lifecycle with automated
vulnerability handling, SBOM generation, and audit-ready evidence,
mapped to NIS2, CRA, and ISO 27001 requirements.”

And immediately prove it.

Customer Assurance Without Engineering Bottlenecks
---------------------------------------------------

Customer security reviews often stall because:

- Engineers are unavailable
- Knowledge is tribal
- Documentation is fragmented

Thinkwerke eliminates this dependency.

Customer-facing teams can:

- Walk customers through documented evidence
- Show real artefacts (not screenshots created last night)
- Answer follow-ups without rework
- Escalate only when truly necessary

Engineering remains focused on delivery — not explanations.

Executive Confidence in Revenue Discussions
-------------------------------------------

For SVPs and executives engaging with:

- Key utility customers
- Public-sector buyers
- Strategic partners
- Regulators

This model provides:

- One consistent security narrative
- Evidence aligned with EU regulation
- Confidence that claims can withstand scrutiny

Sales discussions shift from **“Are you compliant?”**
to **“How fast can we move?”**

Reusable Across Markets
-----------------------

The same evidence supports:

- NIS2 country-specific requirements
- CRA product obligations
- ISO 27001 audits
- Customer security questionnaires
- Partner assurance requests

One framework.
Many outcomes.

Business Outcome
----------------

For Diehl Metering, this delivers:

- Shorter sales cycles
- Higher tender success rates
- Reduced sales-engineering overhead
- Lower compliance risk during revenue growth
- Stronger trust with customers and regulators

Key Takeaway
------------

Security evidence is no longer a cost of doing business.

With Thinkwerke, it becomes:

**A sales enabler.**
