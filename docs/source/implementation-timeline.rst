Implementation Timeline
=======================

A pragmatic, phased execution plan aligned with regulatory deadlines
and business priorities.

**From Proof of Value to multi-country operational compliance
without disruption to delivery or growth.**

Design Principles
-----------------

The implementation approach is designed to:

- Prioritise Germany-first NIS2 obligations
- Scale across countries without duplication
- Align with CRA enforcement timelines
- Avoid re-architecture or delivery slowdowns
- Maintain executive visibility at every stage

This is not a “big bang” programme.

It is a controlled, incremental rollout.

Phase 1 — Proof of Value (6–8 Weeks)
-----------------------------------

**Objective:** Demonstrate feasibility and value on real Diehl Metering context.

Key activities:

- Select representative product / platform
- Implement SSLM pipeline controls
- Establish vulnerability lifecycle and SLAs
- Map German NIS2UmsuCG requirements
- Produce living assurance documentation

**Executive outcome:**
- Visible evidence
- Clear ownership
- Informed decision gate

Phase 2 — Germany NIS2 Operationalisation (Q1–Q2 2026)
------------------------------------------------------

**Objective:** Achieve defensible NIS2 execution under German law.

Key activities:

- Extend framework across priority products
- Prepare for BSI registration and reporting
- Align incident and vulnerability reporting processes
- Establish executive reporting views

**Regulatory milestone:**
- December 6, 2025: NIS2UmsuCG in force
- January 6, 2026: BSI registration & reporting portal opens

**Executive outcome:**
- Regulatory readiness
- Reduced liability exposure
- Confidence during inspections

Phase 3 — Multi-Country NIS2 Expansion (2026)
---------------------------------------------

**Objective:** Scale NIS2 compliance across EU operations.

Key activities:

- Country-specific requirement overlays
- Reuse core controls and evidence
- Avoid duplication between regions
- Maintain unified executive view

**Executive outcome:**
- One framework, many jurisdictions
- Predictable compliance cost
- Reduced operational friction

Phase 4 — CRA Alignment & Product Readiness (2026–2027)
-------------------------------------------------------

**Objective:** Prepare products for CRA enforcement.

Key activities:

- Extend SSLM and SBOM processes
- Formalise vulnerability support periods
- Align documentation with CRA Annex requirements
- Integrate product lifecycle security evidence

**Regulatory milestone:**
- CRA reporting obligations: September 2026
- CRA enforcement: December 2027

**Executive outcome:**
- Future-proof compliance
- Competitive differentiation

Continuous Activities
---------------------

Across all phases:

- Living assurance documentation maintained
- Evidence reused for audits and tenders
- Executive visibility updated continuously
- Sales enablement integrated

Key Takeaway
------------

The timeline aligns regulation with business reality.

No disruption.
No rework.
No surprises.
